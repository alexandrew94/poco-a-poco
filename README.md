## Description

As a former music student, I am painfully aware of how frustrating practicing can be. When learning new music, or when learning a new instrument, it is extremely easy to become frustrated and discouraged by only seeing what you presently can’t do or how much you haven’t done, losing track and losing perspective on all of the progress you’ve in fact already been making this whole time. This web app aims to help music learners learn better by better keeping track and keeping perspective on their progress.

The app was built using a React.js front-end and a Node.js back-end. I used this project as an opportunity to explore data manipulation in-depth, especially with regards to the use of back-end endpoints and how the back-end should serve the data for the many different ways it is to be displayed and/or visualised in the front-end. I chose Chart.js as a data visualisation library, and found it to be robust and a great visual addition to the app. In order to improve the UX, I also made use of the Wikimedia API for an “autocorrect” feature and Moment.js for date manipulation.
